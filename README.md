### wllama

This is an alternate front-end for the [ollama](https://ollama.ai) command line tools.
This is pretty much [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)
but hey it's another chance to use the wonderful [Wails](https://wails.io)
application development library.

The main idea with `ollama` is that it runs locally, without having to hit the
internet. This is why this is an actual application, rather than a web front end.
